<div>
	Determines how to act when a triggered CxSAST scan in synchronous/asynchronous modes fails and returns an error message (i.e. no scan results, not to be
	confused with valid scan results that exceed the threshold).
	<ul>
		<li>FAILURE is equivalent to a Job error that fails the entire build.</li>
		<li>UNSTABLE is equivalent to a Job warning that allows the build to proceed normally but provides an unstable status upon completion.</li>
	</ul>
